# Sample solution for Kaggle Jigsaw competition

Pipeline author: [Andrey Vykhodtsev](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vykhand/)

My work here is focused on tooling, monitoring, execution, clean pipeline and integration with Azure services. Other code was adopted from many public kernels and github repositories that can be [found here]() and [here](). I tried to keep the references to original kernels or githubs in the code comments, when appropritate. I apologize if I missed some references or quotes, and if so, please let me know.

## About this solution

This is the pipeline I developed during the [Kaggle Jigsaw Toxic comment classification challenge](). In this competition, I focused more on tools rather than on winning or developing novel models.

The goal of developing and publishing this is to share reusable code that will help other people run Kaggle competitions on Azure ML Services.

This is the list of features:

I am also writing a blog post which is going to published [here]().

## Presentations and blog posts

This solution is accompanying a few presentations that I gave on PyData meetup in Ljubljana and AI meetup in Zagreb. Links to the slides:

 * PyData Ljubljana #5
 * AI Future Zagreb

## Data downloads

Data for this competition is not distributed with this repository. You need to download it from the competition page located [here](). There are also multiple other external files that I used for this competition:

 * [Google's Full list of banned words]()
 * [Glove embedding vectors]()
 * [FastText embedding vectors]()
